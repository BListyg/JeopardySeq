# JeopardySeq
I have an idea for examining the effect of competitive pressure / competition on risk taking behavior. This came as a result of watching a lot fo Jeopardy with my mom when she came to visit me in Chicago for Thanksgiving 2018.

I decided to scrape the J-Archive website (see [this link](http://www.j-archive.com/showgameresponses.php?game_id=173) for an example of how that data is stored.

There have been [previous attempts](https://github.com/whymarrh/jeopardy-parser) to scrape, parse, and store Jeopardy data, but I wanted to try it myself.

I'm having difficulty with games where there are people who have names with 2 characters (e.g. "Ed").
