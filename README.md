# JeopardySeq
I have an idea for examining how competition can affect risk-taking behavior. This came as a result of watching a lot of Jeopardy with my mom when she came to visit me in Chicago for Thanksgiving 2018. 

## Possible Questions
* Does a person's score, relative to their competitors' scores, predict the amount they bet on for Double Jeopardy/Final Jeopardy? 

* How do winning streaks affect betting behavior? 

* Does the hot hand exist in a purely mental, high stress, endeavor?

## What I did
I decided to scrape the J-Archive website (see [this link](http://www.j-archive.com/showgameresponses.php?game_id=173 for an example of how that data is stored).

There have been [previous attempts](https://github.com/whymarrh/jeopardy-parser) to scrape, parse, and store Jeopardy data, but I wanted to try it myself.

I'm having difficulty with games where there are people who have names with 2 characters (e.g. "Ed").
